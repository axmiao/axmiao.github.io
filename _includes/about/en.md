Hey, I am *axmiao* (An Xiao Miao), a web front-end engineer in a new scientific and technical corporation. 

I studied Mathmatic in Heilongjiang University, and graduated from there by 2017. Though, I have worked as an engineer for about one whole year.

Now I`m learning some new project in technology like vue ,react ,angular and so on , I also learn how to play gitar and how to speak Japanese fluencily on free days.

I will share some course which I think is very well for the learners like me to you, and also some difficulties that occur to me , if you have any problems on it ,you can contact me , I`m glad to disguss with you ~
